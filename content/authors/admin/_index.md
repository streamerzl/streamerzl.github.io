## About Me

Liang Zhang crruently is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Civil Engineering at the University of Cincinnati, with research interests in geotechnical engineering, reliability and risk assessment, uncertainty modelling, bio-inspired design and machine learning-aided design optimization. His current research focuses on the reliability assessment of landslides, and flood protection systems, as well as bio-inspired geotechnical design. In recent years, he has followed the principle of 'complex problems, simple solutions' in his research, as he believes research should ultimately serve practical applications. As a result, the solutions he proposed in his research are designed to be straightforward and easy to follow or implement. He sincerely welcomes opportunities for collaboration in both academic publications and industry projects.
